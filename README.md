Fruit nutrition analysis system - 
Topics on nutrition have become very popular in recent years, given the increased percentage of obesity. One of the most important measures that can be done is raising awareness. This project proves how deep learning models can help towards raising awareness, and how accurate the results can be with good experiments. These papers show how CNN models can be used for object detection and weight estimation, which can result in outputting the nutritional values of the food in images. Given the fruit dataset that contains approximately 15,000 images of 6 types of fruits: apple, banana, orange, tomato, watermelon, and potato, during this research project there, can be seen how models created from scratch performed on detecting the type of fruit and compared to the results extracted from using the Facebook AI Research’s Detectron2 model. Moreover, for addressing the weight estimation problem, this paper contains two ways of doing it, the first one is represented by the modification of the models built for fruit detection to be changed from classifier to regressor, and the second one is represented by using a residual network – Resnet-50 – that was changed for regression and predicted the weights of the fruits in the images.
